# jq Error Message Conformance and Known Limitations

[Home](../../../) > [Docs](../../) > [Compliance](../) > jq Limitations

This page records how closely succinctly's evaluator reproduces jq's *error messages*,
measured against the pinned `jq` binary rather than asserted. Since
[#158](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/158) bound the raised value as
`catch`'s input, the message text is readable from a filter — `try f catch (if
test("Cannot index") then … else … end)` is a real jq idiom — so the wording is part of
the observable surface, not stderr decoration.

Every expectation is captured from jqlang/jq at the version in
[`tests/data/jq-golden/JQ_VERSION`](../../../tests/data/jq-golden/JQ_VERSION); regenerate
and verify with:

```bash
./scripts/sync-jq-error-messages.sh          # recapture from the pinned jq
./scripts/sync-jq-error-messages.sh --check  # verify the table has not drifted
cargo test --features cli,regex --test jq_error_message_tests -- --nocapture
```

For jq *feature* coverage rather than error wording, see
[jq Language Support](../../reference/jq-language.md).

## Summary

Measured against jq-1.7.1 over the 143 probes in
[`tests/data/jq-error-probes.tsv`](../../../tests/data/jq-error-probes.tsv), through
**both** evaluators — the full one (`src/jq/eval.rs`) and the generic one
(`src/jq/eval_generic.rs`, which the CLI uses):

| Dimension                                    | Result              | Meaning                                            |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Message text** (both evaluators, verbatim) | **141/143 = 98.6%** | Byte-identical to jq                               |
| **Wording divergences**                      | **0**               | Every probe that errors in both errors identically |
| **Behaviour / parser gaps**                  | **2**               | succinctly does not raise the error at all         |

These three numbers are asserted, not maintained by hand: `jq_error_message_tests.rs`
parses them back out of this page and fails if they drift from the corpus (they went stale
twice while #356 was being written).

The non-passing probes are enumerated individually, with a category, reason and issue
link, in
[`tests/data/jq-error-known-divergences.txt`](../../../tests/data/jq-error-known-divergences.txt).
That file is the machine-readable source of truth; the test asserts it matches reality
exactly in both directions — a newly diverging probe and a newly matching one both break
the build — so it cannot silently drift from this page.

Crucially, **none of them is a wording bug**. In each case succinctly returns a value
or fails to compile the filter, so there is no message to compare; the wording is already
correct in `src/jq/error.rs` and will be reached once the underlying bug is fixed.

What the corpus *cannot* see is the mirror image — a filter on which succinctly raises an
error and jq returns a value — because a probe is only admitted if jq errors on it. Those
are listed in [Where succinctly errors and jq does not](#where-succinctly-errors-and-jq-does-not).

## The message vocabulary

jq reuses a small number of sentence shapes across many operations — `.a`, `.a = 1`,
`del(.a)`, `getpath(["a"])` and `. as {a:$a}` all report the *same* indexing error. Each
shape has one named constructor in [`src/jq/error.rs`](../../../src/jq/error.rs), so the
vocabulary is enumerable in one place rather than inlined at the ~300 raise sites where
it used to live. That inlining is how the two evaluators drifted from each other as well
as from jq: before #356 they reported `expected array or object, got number` and `cannot
iterate over number` for the same condition, and `cannot parse 'a' as number` against
`cannot convert 'a' to number` for `tonumber`.

| Shape                                                    | Constructor                                   |

| `Cannot index <t> with <key-type>`                       | `cannot_index_with_type`                      |
| `Cannot iterate over <t> (<v>)`                          | `cannot_iterate`                              |
| `<a> and <b> cannot be added\|subtracted\|…`             | `binary_op`                                   |
| `… because the divisor is zero`                          | `divisor_is_zero`                             |

| `<a> and <b> cannot be iterated over`                    | `pair_cannot_be_iterated`                     |
| `<v> has no keys` / `has no length`                      | `has_no_keys`, `has_no_length`                |
| `<v> cannot be sorted, as it is not an array`            | `cannot_be_sorted`                            |

| `<v> cannot be parsed as a number`                       | `cannot_parse_as_number`                      |
| `<v> only strings can be parsed`                         | `only_strings_can_be_parsed`                  |
| `<v> only strings have UTF-8 byte length`                | `no_utf8_byte_length`                         |
| `Cannot check whether <t> has a <key-type> key`          | `cannot_check_has`                            |
| `Cannot use <t> (<v>) as object key`                     | `cannot_use_as_object_key`                    |
| `Invalid numeric literal at EOF at line 1, column <n> …` | `invalid_numeric_literal`                     |

`EvalError::type_error` ("expected X, got Y") survives for the raise sites jq has no
counterpart for — succinctly extensions (`at_offset`, `@dsv`, `pick`/`omit`, module
loading) and builtins jq does not define. Anything jq also reports should use a named
constructor instead.

### One sentence covers a family, so probe the whole family

jq derives many builtins from others (`ascii_upcase` and `ascii_downcase` are both
`explode | map(…) | implode`; `to_entries` and `keys` both go through `keys_unsorted`;
`indices`, `index` and `rindex` all index their input with the pattern), so a sentence
fixed for one member is owed by every member. Fixing only the member a probe named left
`1 | with_entries(.)` saying `number (1) has no keys` while `1 | to_entries` beside it
still said `expected object, got number`. The corpus now carries at least one probe per
member for these families, and the sites that shared wording share a definition —
`non_string_pattern` and `unsearchable_input` in `src/jq/eval.rs` are the two refusals
behind all three string searches.

The families are worth naming, because "fix the site the probe names" caught this twice
in a row: the first pass fixed the *pattern* half of `indices`/`index`/`rindex` and left
their *input* half saying `expected string or array, got number`, one arm below. The rule
that holds is per family, not per raise site.

Sometimes jq's own source names the family outright. `strings` on the pinned binary yields:

```jq
def from_entries: map({(.key // .Key // .name // .Name): (if has("value") then .value else .Value end)}) | add | .//={};
def with_entries(f): to_entries | map(f) | from_entries;
```

So `from_entries` *is* object construction, and `with_entries` *is* `from_entries` — one
raise site in jq behind `{(0):1}`, `[{"key":0}] | from_entries` and
`{"a":1} | with_entries(.key = 0)` alike, which is why all three share
`cannot_use_as_object_key`. Succinctly had it as three: two hand-written copies of the
entry lookup (`from_entries` and `with_entries` reimplemented it separately, and neither
called the other) plus `key must be a string` in `eval_object_construction`. Both copies
*dropped* the entry rather than refusing it, so the caller got a smaller object with no
indication anything was lost — #391. The lookup now has one definition,
`entries_to_object` in `src/jq/eval.rs`, and `with_entries` is composed from
`builtin_to_entries` and it rather than restating either.

That composition is also what fixed `[1,2] | with_entries(.)`. jq reaches
`Cannot use number (0) as object key` because `to_entries` accepts an array — its keys are
the indices — and hands those number keys to `from_entries`. Succinctly's `with_entries`
matched only an object, so it reported `array ([1,2]) has no keys` from a type check jq
has not got. Deriving the builtin from the two it is defined over is what makes the right
sentence arrive without anyone choosing it.

The same source line pins the *alias* semantics, and its two halves disagree on purpose:
the key is a `//` chain (`key`, `Key`, `name`, `Name` — an alias holding `null` or `false`
is passed over in favour of a later one), while the value is a presence test (`value`, then
`Value` — an explicit `"value": null` beats a `"Value"` beside it). Succinctly had accepted
`k` and `v`, which jq does not, and neither `Key`/`Name`/`Value`, which it does. Correcting
the chain was a precondition for raising the error rather than a tidy-up beside it:
refusing a non-string key while still reading the wrong aliases would have failed
`[{"Key":"a","value":1}]` and `[{"key":null,"name":"a","value":1}]`, both of which jq
answers. The chain is pinned by golden cases (`from_entries_key_aliases`,
`from_entries_alias_falls_through_null`, `from_entries_value_aliases`) rather than probes,
because it is value behaviour and no probe can hold a filter jq does not error on.

"Passed over in favour of a later one" is exact, and *not* the same as falling through: the
chain's **last** alias has nothing later to be preferred, so `a // b` yields `b` whatever
`b` is. A falsy `.Name` is therefore the key, and `[{"Name":false}] | from_entries` is
`Cannot use boolean (false) as object key` — not the `null (null)` a uniform fall-through
would produce. Reading the tail as falling through too is the easy mistake, and the case
that hides it is a tail that is merely *absent*, which really is `null`; the probe pair
`from_entries_falsy_tail_key` / `from_entries_absent_tail_key` exists to separate them, with
`from_entries_alias_falsy_tail` pinning the same case end-to-end through the CLI. This half
of the chain *can* be probed, unlike the rest of it, precisely because jq errors here.

### Value rendering and truncation

Most shapes embed the offending value as `<type> (<json>)`. jq truncates that dump to a
fixed-width buffer (`jv_dump_string_trunc` with `char errbuf[15]`): a dump of at most 14
bytes is used verbatim, anything longer keeps its first 11 bytes and gains a `...`
suffix. Reproduced exactly:

```bash
$ echo '"abcdefghijkl"'  | sjq -c 'try .[] catch .'
"Cannot iterate over string (\"abcdefghijkl\")"     # 14 bytes — verbatim
$ echo '"abcdefghijklm"' | sjq -c 'try .[] catch .'
"Cannot iterate over string (\"abcdefghij...)"      # 15 bytes — truncated
```

String *keys* in indexing messages are not truncated; `.["aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"]` on a
number reports the whole twenty-character key.

## Truncation that splits a multi-byte character

jq cuts the dump at a byte offset and will happily split a UTF-8 sequence, emitting
invalid UTF-8:

```bash
$ echo '"あああああ"' | jq '.[]' | cat -v
jq: error (at <stdin>:1): Cannot iterate over string ("M-cM-^AM-^BM-cM-^AM-^BM-cM-^AM-^BM-oM-?M-=...)
                                                     # "あああ + a lone 0xE3 byte
```

A Rust `String` cannot hold that, so `dump_truncated` snaps back to the nearest character
boundary and emits `"あああ...` — one byte shorter, no replacement character. The two
agree whenever the cut lands on a boundary, which includes every 2-byte character
(`"ααααα...`, exactly 11 bytes).

This case is deliberately **absent from the probe corpus**: the captured table is a UTF-8
file read with `include_str!`, so jq's byte-exact output here is not representable. It is
recorded in prose instead rather than dropped silently.

## Conversion diagnostics beyond a single token

jq implements `tonumber` and `fromjson` by handing the string to its JSON parser, so a
failure surfaces as that parser's diagnostic. succinctly reproduces the single-token
form exactly:

```bash
$ echo '"0x10"' | sjq -c 'try tonumber catch .'
"Invalid numeric literal at EOF at line 1, column 4 (while parsing '0x10')"
```

and distinguishes it from a string that *is* valid JSON but is not a number, which jq
reports as the string itself:

```bash
$ echo '"null"' | sjq -c 'try tonumber catch .'
"string (\"null\") cannot be parsed as a number"
```

Inputs that fail *after* a complete token get a different jq diagnostic that succinctly
approximates to the EOF form:

| Input     | jq                                                     | succinctly                                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"1 2"`   | `Unexpected extra JSON values (while parsing '1 2')`   | `Invalid numeric literal at EOF at line 1, column 3 (while parsing '1 2')` |
| `"1,2"`   | `Expected value before ',' at line 1, column 2 …`      | as above, with the EOF column                                        |
| `"{"`     | `Unfinished JSON term at EOF at line 1, column 1 …`    | as above                                                             |
| `"  a  "` | `Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 4 …`        | as above, but with `at EOF` and column 5                             |

Matching these needs a position-reporting JSON parser reporting jq's exact failure
classes; the hand-rolled `parse_complete_json` in `src/jq/eval.rs` does not carry offsets.
The shapes a filter is likely to branch on (`Invalid numeric literal`, `cannot be parsed
as a number`) are exact, so this is left as a deliberate approximation.

Both builtins do require the *whole* string to be one JSON value, which is the part that
matters for the result rather than the message: `"0x10" | fromjson` errors as jq does
instead of returning `0`, and `"1 2" | fromjson` errors instead of returning `1`.

## Float literals lose their source spelling

jq's arithmetic messages echo the literal as written, because it keeps the number's
original text:

```bash
$ echo null | jq '1 / 0.0'
jq: error (at <stdin>:1): number (1) and number (0.0) cannot be divided because the divisor is zero
```

`OwnedValue::Float(0.0).to_json()` renders `0`, so succinctly says `number (0)` there.
This is the general "JSON numbers are re-rendered, not echoed" property of the evaluator
rather than anything specific to errors, and it only shows for float literals whose
shortest rendering differs from their source spelling.

## Behaviour and parser gaps

The probes on record are not wording problems — succinctly never raises the error, so
there is nothing to word. Each has its own issue and is listed in
[`tests/data/jq-error-known-divergences.txt`](../../../tests/data/jq-error-known-divergences.txt).

| Probe(s)                                                          | Divergence                                                       | Issue |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `slice_assign_non_array`, `slice_indices_not_integers`            | A slice is not a path component, so `setpath` leaves the value alone | [#366](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/366) |

`index_null_key_on_object`, `index_bool_key_on_object` and `index_object_key_on_object`
were on this list too, as parser gaps: `.[null]`, `.[true]` and `.[{}]` did not parse, so
no runtime error was reached. [#360](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/360)
made index brackets take an arbitrary expression, and all three now raise jq's
`Cannot index object with <type>`.

`setpath_on_number` was on this list too. [#359](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/359)
fixed it: `setpath` now auto-vivifies only `null`, as jq does, and refuses to index
anything else at any depth. The `setpath_*` probes added alongside it pin the rest of that
surface — wrong-key-type on a real container, out-of-bounds negative and NaN indices, and a
non-array path argument.

## Where succinctly errors and jq does not

A probe is only admitted to the corpus if jq errors on it, so the corpus is blind to the
opposite divergence: a filter that jq answers with a value and succinctly refuses. Those
have to be recorded here.

| Filter          | Input         | jq                          | succinctly                            |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `.a = 1`        | `null`        | `{"a":1}`                   | `Cannot index null with string "a"`   |
| `.a.b = 1`      | `{}`          | `{"a":{"b":1}}`             | `Cannot index null with string "b"`   |
| `.[5] = 9`      | `[1,2]`       | `[1,2,null,null,null,9]`    | `index 5 out of bounds (length 2)`    |
| `.[5] \|= 9`    | `[1,2]`       | `[1,2,null,null,null,9]`    | `index 5 out of bounds (length 2)`    |
| `del(.[5])`     | `[1,2]`       | `[1,2]`                     | `index 5 out of bounds (length 2)`    |
| `del(.[-5])`    | `[1,2]`       | `[1,2]`                     | `Out of bounds negative array index`  |

Every row is an assignment, update or deletion walking a path *in place*, and every one is
older than #356 — the rewording changed what these say, not whether they say it. The gap
they share is auto-vivification: jq grows the container the path asks for (`null` into an
object, an array up to the index) and treats an unreachable delete as a no-op.

An object key that yields something other than exactly one value is a second, unrelated
group — it is the key half of
[#354](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/354):

| Filter        | Input       | jq                       | succinctly             |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `{(empty):1}` | `0`         | *(no output)*            | `key must be a string` |
| `{(.[]):1}`   | `["a","b"]` | `{"a":1}` then `{"b":1}` | `key must be a string` |

jq's object construction takes the cartesian product over each key's outputs, so a key
producing nothing produces no object and a key producing two produces two. Succinctly
evaluates the key to a single value and refuses anything else, with wording of its own —
the one sentence left in `eval_object_construction`, because reaching jq's answer here
means generating a stream, not renaming an error. The sentence stays succinctly's until
#354 is built.

`setpath` is the same operation without the syntax, and after #359 it does follow jq —
`[1,2] | setpath([5]; 9)` is `[1,2,null,null,null,9]`, and `null | setpath(["a"]; 1)` is
`{"a":1}`. So the two disagree with each other in-tree today; closing that means teaching
`set_path`/`update_path`/`delete_at_path` to vivify the way `set_value_at_path` now does.

Where the same walk *does* error in jq, the sentence matches. A still-negative index is
jq's `Out of bounds negative array index` in `=` and `|=` as well as `setpath`, pinned by
the probes `assign_negative_index_oob`, `update_negative_index_oob` and
`assign_negative_index_nested`; `del` raises the same sentence, which is why the last row
above shows it against a jq that does not raise at all. `index N out of bounds (length M)`
is succinctly's own wording, kept deliberately for the positive case rather than borrowing
a jq sentence for something jq never says.

## Refusing an allocation jq does not survive

`setpath` takes its array index from the document, so the array it pads is sized by the
input: `null | setpath([1e30]; 9)` asks for 9.2e18 elements. jq dies on that filter (it is
killed on the allocation, with no message to reproduce), and succinctly used to panic with
`capacity overflow`, which for a library means taking the embedder's process down. It now
refuses with `Cannot grow array to <n> elements` — succinctly's own wording, since there is
no jq sentence to copy. Only the impossible is refused; every length that fits in memory
still pads, so `[1,2] | setpath([5]; 9)` still agrees with jq.

## A slice is not a path component

jq models `.[1:2]` as indexing with `{"start":1,"end":2}`, and treats that object as a
first-class path component: it comes out of `path()`, goes into `getpath`/`setpath`, and
drives `=`, `|=` and `del()`. succinctly can *read* a slice but does not treat it as a path,
so `[1,2,3] | setpath([{"start":1,"end":2}]; ["x"])` leaves the value untouched where jq
gives `[1,"x",3]`. The full divergence table is in
[#366](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/366).

That is a missing feature rather than a wording divergence, and it is deliberately *not*
raised as an error — inventing a message jq does not print would be a fresh divergence.
Only the containers jq would slice get that pass; on a scalar, an object path element is
refused with jq's `Cannot index <type> with object` (probe `setpath_slice_key_on_number`).

The same gap reaches `indices`/`index`/`rindex`, which jq also lets take a slice:
`"abcabc" | indices({"start":1,"end":2})` is `"b"` there, and `indices({})` is `Array/string
slice indices must be integers`. succinctly refuses both with `Cannot index string with
object`. Every *other* pattern type reports jq's sentence exactly (probes
`indices_number_pattern_on_string`, `index_null_pattern_on_string`,
`rindex_array_pattern_on_string`), so the object case is the only one left, and it closes
with #366 rather than separately.

The two error sentences the feature owes jq — `A slice of an array can only be assigned
another array` and `Array/string slice indices must be integers` — are pinned as probes and
listed in the divergence manifest against #366, so the two-sided check fails the build the
moment either starts matching.

## Errors reach the CLI with the right text but the wrong exit code

`succinctly jq` prints an uncaught evaluation error to stderr with jq's wording, but exits
0 where jq exits 5. That is tracked separately as
[#355](https://github.com/rust-works/succinctly/issues/355) and is why the error cases in
the golden corpus are written as `try … catch .`: the caught form puts the message on
stdout and exits 0, so it verifies the text through the real binary without depending on
the exit-code fix.

succinctly also omits jq's `(at <stdin>:N)` input-location prefix, which is emitted by
jq's CLI rather than its evaluator and is therefore outside the message the two share.

The captured table is committed, so `cargo test` runs hermetically with no `jq` on PATH.
The `jq-drift` CI job re-checks it against the pinned binary, in the same step group as
the golden fixtures — so a jq upgrade surfaces as churn in the table and the divergence
manifest rather than as a silent mismatch.

To move to a newer jq, bump `JQ_VERSION`, install that version, run
`./scripts/sync-jq-error-messages.sh` and `./scripts/sync-jq-golden.sh`, and review the
diff.
